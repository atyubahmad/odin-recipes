        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna originated in Italy. The earliest known recipe for lasagna can be traced back to the 14th century, and the dish likely developed out of a need to use up leftover ingredients. It is believed that lasagna was originally made with layers of pasta, cheese, and vegetables or meats. Over time, the dish evolved and various regional variations developed, each with its own unique ingredients and flavors. Today, lasagna is a popular dish worldwide, with many different recipes and variations.</p> 
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta sheets, such as lasagna noodles or fresh pasta.</li>
            <li>Ground meat, such as beef, chicken, or lamb.</li>
            <li>Chopped vegetables, such as onions, garlic, bell peppers, and mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce or canned tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese.</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs, such as basil, oregano, and parsley.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a large baking dish with oil or cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta sheets according to the package instructions. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, heat some oil over medium heat and add the chopped onions and garlic. Cook until the onions are softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the ground meat to the saucepan and cook until it is browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped vegetables to the saucepan and continue cooking until they are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato sauce and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce cook for 10-15 minutes, or until it has thickened.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and fresh herbs.</li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of the tomato meat sauce on the bottom of the baking dish. Add a layer of pasta sheets on top, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of sauce and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover the lasagna with foil and bake it in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese is melted and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
