        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>Beef or lamb shanks, cut into large pieces</li>
            <li>Whole wheat flour or all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Ghee or oil</li>
            <li>Onion, chopped</li>

            <li>Ginger, minced</li>
            <li>Whole spices, such as bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, black peppercorns, and cardamom pods</li>

            <li>Water or beef broth</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat some ghee or oil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the flour and a pinch of salt. Dredge the beef or lamb shanks in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.</li>
            <li>Brown the shanks in the hot ghee or oil, turning them occasionally, until they are golden brown on all sides.</li>
            <li>Remove the shanks from the pot and set them aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, heat some more ghee or oil and add the chopped onions. Cook until the onions are softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger to the pot and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the whole spices to the pot and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the ground spices to the pot and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Return the browned shanks to the pot and add enough water or beef broth to cover them. Bring the liquid to a simmer and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the nihari cook for 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.</li>
            <li>Stir in the lemon juice and season the nihari with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve the nihari hot, with naan bread or rice on the side. Enjoy!</li>
