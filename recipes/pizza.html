        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pizza is a popular dish that originated in Italy, specifically in the city of Naples. It is made by baking a flatbread dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and other ingredients, such as meats and vegetables. The origins of pizza can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, who ate a similar type of food called "plakous," which consisted of flatbread topped with honey, cheese, and herbs. The modern pizza as we know it today was developed in Naples in the 18th century, and it quickly became a popular dish among the poor who could afford the cheap and filling meal. Over time, pizza became popular all over Italy and eventually spread to other parts of the world.</p>
